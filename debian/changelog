abiword (2.6.4-4) unstable; urgency=high

  * The "Strike three, yer out!" release.
  * Creating the dummy abiword-plugins package created yet another scenario
    where we have to remove the diversions to the desktop files created by
    the old packages.

abiword (2.6.4-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * The "Strike two" release.
  * Creating the dummy abiword-plugins package created a scenario where
    abiword-plugin-grammar would conflict filewise with the old
    abiword-plugins package, so add a Conflicts for abiword-plugins (<< 2.6.4)
    to the grammar and mathview plugin packages.

abiword (2.6.4-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * The "Please Ubuntu, take this package!" release.
  * New upstream stable release, incorporating many build bits from Ryan
    Pavlik. Thanks! (His Ubuntu changelogs follow this entry.)
    closes: #473508, #488069
  * Using medium priority to try and beat the freeze given the NEW delay
    that this package will incur.

  * Major changes:
    - Split out the abiword-plugins and abiword-plugins-gnome package into
      three individual plugin packages:

      Recommended: abiword-plugin-mathview, abiword-plugin-grammar
      Suggested: abiword-plugin-goffice (due to GNOME dependencies)

    - The old abiword-plugins and abiword-plugins-gnome packages have been
      obsoleted and abiword-plugins-gnome is now a Conflicts/Replaces in
      abiword. Because abiword-plugins has been split into two packages,
      though, there is a dummy abiword-plugins package to ease upgrades.

    - There is no more abiword-gnome package. We only ship the GTK2 version,
      which does depend on GNOME-Print, but that does not rely on the usual
      large set of GNOME UI libraries.

    - Many of the file import/export plugins formerly provided only by the
      abiword-plugins package are now included in the base distribution to
      provide the best out-of-box functionality for those who install only
      the abiword package. This means that no matter what, the abiword package
      now has ODF/OOXML support.

  * Minor changes:
    - Drop psiconv support overall to alleviate dependency bloat/package spam,
      at the risk of offending the one guy who still has a Psion 5.
    - Upgrade to debhelper 7 and Policy 3.8.0.
    - Drop one of Ryan's Ubuntu patches by building abiword-2.6.pc in the
      configure stage of debian/rules. Lose autoconf/automake build dep.
    - Upgrade boost build-dependency to 1.35 to quell some apt-get insanity
      while pbuilder satisfies the Build-Depends.

  * Bug fixes from upstream:
    - Print preview now matches onscreen layout more accurately.
      closes: #336216
    - Font operations are all done using Pango now, so the XAP_UnixFont
      crash should no longer occur. closes: #443048, #444957
    - Spellcheck button is no longer greyed out gratuitously. closes: #422520
    - "!!" and "??" in DejaVu Sans Mono seem to be correctly monospaced
      now. closes: #470949
    - AbiWord can now import OpenWriter files without a MIME type.
      closes: #376417
    - Build error affecting 2.4.6 was already fixed upstream, but thanks
      to Peter Green for the patch and Lucas Nussbaum for the report.
      closes: #490414

abiword (2.0.14-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * I'm now a comaintainer. I think. Add myself to Uploaders.
      < mhatta_> do you want to be a co-maintainer of abiword?
      < mhatta_> I'm a MIA in reality, so your help is appreciated
  * New upstream version fixes:
    - spontaneous window opening on AbiWord startup, closes: #263707
    - inability to print grayscale PNGs, closes: #117005, #140025, #256650
  * Patch work:
    - (CHANGED) 01_relibtoolise.dpatch: Refresh. Autotools suck.
    - (ADDED) 06_support_vnd.ms-word.dpatch: Part of the fix for #274643.
    - (ADDED) 07_page_down_crash.dpatch: Backport from HEAD a crash fix
      based on a graphics generation race condition that could occur if
      one pressed Page Down before it finished.
    - (ADDED) 08_bad_g_prgname.dpatch: Set g_prgname to something that
      matches the name of the corresponding binary (AbiWord-2.0 in this
      case, instead of AbiWord.) This allows bug-buddy to grab a stack
      trace from the right program in case a crash occurs. closes: #243243
    - (ADDED) 09_browser_handling.dpatch: Improve browser handling (launch
      console browsers in an x-terminal-emulator, and check for x-www-browser
      above all.)
  * Fix grammatical error in abw2html.1. closes: #272604
  * Also s/\.pl//g; s/\.sh//g in all manpages.
  * Add abiword as a viewer for application/vnd.ms-word. closes: #274643
  * Add more mailcap entries for abiword/abiword-plugins, based on the
    .server file provided by upstream.
  * Remove upstream-obsoleted ttftool/ttfadmin. Only useful in the
    pre-Fontconfig days of AbiWord. Since it is no longer installed, this
    closes: #233321.
  * Stop shipping the old KDE desktop file. closes: #273217
  * Install mime-info, applications and desktop files in the common package.
    There's no sin in letting non-gnomeui apps use them. (Replaces: in
    abiword-common takes care of transitioning for us.)
  * Change Recommends: abiword | abiword-gnome to a Depends. By virtue of
    the problem no longer really existing this closes: #228260
  * Add a blank postinst file for abiword-common (only containing hashbang +
    #DEBHELPER#) to potentially ease some upgrades. closes: #270815

      a missing argument to a findNext function. Rebuild with xsubpp.
  * abw2html.pl link in abiword-common becomes just 'abw2html' (still
    points to the abw2html.pl in /usr/share, though.) (Closes: #189539)
  * Quote entries in the menu file for abiword-common.
