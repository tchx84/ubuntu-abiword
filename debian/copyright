 About Trademark
 (See also http://www.abisource.com/information/license/tm_guide.phtml)
 .
 Trademark Usage Guidelines
 .
 AbiSource Trademarks
 .
 AbiSource, AbiWord, AbiCalc, AbiFile, AbiSuite, AbiShow and other
 AbiSource graphics, logos and service names are trademarks of Dom
 Lachowicz. These trademarks may not be used in connection with any
 product or service that is not AbiSource's, in any manner that is
 likely to cause confusion among customers, or in any manner that
 disparages or discredits AbiSource.
 .
 Trademarks and the GPL
 .
 AbiSource software products, such as AbiWord, are copyrighted works
 released under the terms of the GNU General Public License
 (GPL). Verbatim copies of such works may be made and distributed, by
 anyone, in accordance with the terms of the GPL without violating the
 AbiSource trademarks. The GPL also grants you certain rights to make
 and distribute derivative works based on the source code to AbiSource
 products.
 .
 The GPL does not grant you any right to use AbiSource trademarks in
 connection with these derivative works. AbiSource trademarks may not
 be used in connection with any such derivative works unless that usage
 is explicitly and specifically licensed, in writing, from Dom
 Lachowicz.
 .
 Personal exemption
 .
 As a specific exception, AbiSource freely licenses the use of certain
 of its trademarks solely in combination with the suffix "Personal"
 when applied to derivative works based on an AbiSource GPL
 product. Thus, for example, you are free to use the mark "AbiWord
 Personal" in connection with derivative works that are based on
 "AbiWord". To help maintain this distinction, AbiSource releases the
 sources to its GPL products with Personal-based trademarks.
 .
 We are not lawyers
 .
 Trademark and copyright issues are, at heart, legal matters. We've
 tried to keep this explanation as simple and common-sense as possible,
 but if you have any questions about when and how to use AbiSource
 trademarks, your best bet is to ask a lawyer. We are not lawyers.
 .
 We are not evil
 .
 Our goal is very simple. We want to make sure our software stays Open
 Source, no matter what. That's why we chose the GPL. We also want
 everyone to know which products are ours. That's why we are so picky
 about our trademarks.
 .
 "AbiWord" vs. "AbiWord Personal" for Debian?
 .
 Maybe this is informative for now.
